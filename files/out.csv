0,   Everything has been mapped. We have satellites. We have Google Earth. Why do they need to continually keep mapping?,1551227295788064768,0,2022-07-24 15:26:22+00:00," Well, it turns out that even though we have a fairly good understanding of what is on the surface, the surface is not the only thing that matters when it comes to the planet. The oceans cover more than 70 percent of the planet. And the"

5,"  You are all over the place. Outer space not real? Can you prove sky ends? We did not go to moon (you are correct here), no one is saying we went to Mars. Satellites don't fly in outer space, they primarily free-fall in low-Earth orbit.",1551223331033997312,0,2022-07-24 15:10:37+00:00," There are plenty of things in outer space, but we don't know what they are, so we call them ""dark matter"".

9,"You might ask, making EVs for Tesla there, why destroy the satellites in another corps? How it work, Musk not necessarily running space x, a figure head, same as many of your political leaders.
